        <h2>  3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h2> 
       <p>The IT tools and systems used had some pros and cons see table below. Many of the tasks could have been divided by team members, stages or by tasks. this would have saved time and allowed for a more specialised type of work focusing on streghts of each team. This method can improve quality and allows sharing skills and technical knowledge.

        <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency  </h2>
        <p><strong> Ways to improve productivity can include;</strong> <br><br> clarity with the task ahead, good and effective planning, delegation of tasks, team members responsibility and accountability, tracking progress at various stages.<br><br>
        During the project, I found using <a href=" https://trello.com"> Trello</a> and the checklist in a systematic way allowed me to reduce the stress levels and worries about technical aspects of the project and increased my creativity and ideas.<br><br>
       Using <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/">Slack</a>, as a tool to <a href="https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/increase-productivity-strategies"> improve productivity</a>.<br> <br>
       In addition, having clarity, tracking the project, remove distractions and also important its <a href="https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/case-linking-employee-wellbeing-productivity/"> wellbeing </a>, and good time management.<br><br>
       <strong>The focus should be:</strong><br><br>
        Personal: accountability, responsibility and "mind" your health and wellbeing.  &#x2705<br><br>
        Technology or external factors: Goals, lists, time management and  tracking. &#x2705<br>
        </p>
       <br>
       <br>
<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>
<p>For my next project, I would definitely implement more digital productivity tools such as slack and Trello. I would have the team clearly dividing  tasks and ensuring accountability for their work and learning. Part of team-work is to also ensure support is available and members are not overwhelmed with the tasks. <br><br>
    <strong>Im still designing my list of favourite tools to use. Currently starts with:</strong><br><br>
    Step 1 - clarity on tasks, goals and objectives and good planning.<br><br>
    Step 2 - Set up Slack and Trello. <br><br>
    Step 3 - Draw.io and flow charts. Reviews and adapt as needed. <br><br>
    Step 4 - Have a working and flexible system, checklist for tracking, review, adapt and test! <br><br>
</p>

<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
<p>
   Testing digital solutions can be done against the outcome measures ste for each aspect of the project. The steps allow for detection of errors and bugs as well verification and validation that ensure the system is meeting the required functionalities and the overall inspection of the software. <a href="https://www.w3schools.in/software-testing/principles/"> More on testing</a>
