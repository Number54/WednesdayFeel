  <p>The Website is divided into 3 separate layouts, they all have a navigation bar menu, content and a footer.<br>
    I have decided on the one column to keep the theme and it is also easier for mobile users.</p>

<button class="accordion">About Me Page</button>

  <p>The About Me page contains a navigation menu, header, photo, content and the footer.</p>

<button class="accordion">Unit Outcome Pages and References</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The Unit Outcome pages are similar in layout and don't have a header.<br>
    The References and privacy pages, have the navigation bar menu, content and footer only.<br>
    The footer is placed at the bottom of the page and contains links to copyright, GDPR, Privacy and References pages.</p>

    <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2>
    <p>Building a website requires understanding about copyright, especially for content, fonts, photos, etc.<br><br>
    <strong>Fonts </strong><br>
    There are many ways to find additional fonts. These can be payed or Open Font Licence <a href="https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL"> (OFL)</a>. A variety of font generators and libraries can be found online such as <a href="https://fonts.google.com">Google fonts</a>, <a href="https://www.monotype.com/fonts">Monotype</a>, <a href="https://www.fonts.com"> Fonts</a>, and many others. This will depend on requirements, style, creativity and budget.<br><br>   

    When developing my Website, I have searched many images, photos and vector signs. My aim was to create a clean look that transferred a message that could be picked subconsciously and give some continuity and reinforce the written message.<br><br>

   Photos, images and vectors are other aspect protected by copyright laws that require careful consideration. There are many stock photo websites, <a href="https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/"> Getty Images</a>, <a href="https://unsplash.com/"> Unplash</a> for licenced and royalty free images. It is important to acknowledge the author and add a link of this information. Using copyright material without permission from the owner, can lead to legal disputes. This can be reduced by respecting author's intellectual property (IP) this also applies to written content and <a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/scholarly/publishing/using-copyrighted-content/"> fair usage policies.</a> There are many resources online with information and reviews on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ip-enforcement-reports">copywrite infringement</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protecting-creativity-supporting-innovation-ip-enforcement-2020"></a> laws protecting IP. The British library offers information as well as free training sessions on <a href="https://www.bl.uk/business-and-ip-centre/articles/what-is-copyright"> protecting IP.</a><br><br><br>

  <strong>Colours</strong><br>

  Reviewing and choosing  colours for the website required me  exploring and testing online colour generators such as <a href="https://coolors.co">Coolors</a>. Using this type of tool allowed me to find and match harmonious colour pallets, that were easily uploaded into CSS or saved as a different file format- see my Trello board for details.<br><br>

  Whist searching for <a href="http://www.colour-affects.co.uk/psychological-properties-of-colours"> colour combinations</a> I have searched information on  the <a href="https://www.nickkolenda.com/color-psychology/#color-brand-personality">psychology of colours.</a> <br>I was aiming at a  clean and straight forward look that inspired confidence, sincerity  and calmness. Searching the psychology of colours was helpful and helped me inspire the process. </p><br><br>

   <h2> 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>

  <p>People with disabilities face many barriers for equality in receiving services and accessing resources. The <a href="
  https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/6">Equality Act 2010</a> and the <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/disability-discrimination">Human Rights </a> set the standards for inclusion and lawful service provision for people with disabilities. However, this is still behind and some of the wording used such as “reasonable adjustments” for services  can be considered ambiguous and can lead to an open interpretation for the detriment of the person with disabilities. <br><br>

 The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps">government guidance for accessibility</a> stipulates that technology should be made available or accessible for as many people as possible taking into account people within the following categories: impaired vision, motor difficulties, cognitive impairments or learning disabilities and deafness or impaired hearing. <br><br>

The accessibility adjustments include, content that is easy to navigate and reading, can be used with assistive technology (AT), high or low tech, when possible provided in alternative format.<br><br>

 During my career as an Occupational Therapist I have advocated for accessibility for my clients. Many of my patients had suffered brain injuries and in many cases this lead to diffuse deficits and reduces people’s independence.<br><br>

  For example, a person with visual deficits can experiences colour contrast difficulties and they cannot differentiate objects with similar colour.<br>

  The same applies to a website, if the  colours are very similar or there is not enough contrast, this can affect people with certain visual deficits. They will not be able to read the text or see where the buttons are.<br><br>

  People with neurodiversity, may find "busy" websites confusing and cognitively demanding and they may avoid using it.<br><br>
  The layout should have or follow the standard visual scanning patterns.  In western countries specifically that use Latin, Germanic and Greek  based languages, the visual scanning pattern is from left to right,  up  and down, as it is the same for reading and writing. This changes for Chinese or Arabic characters or languages.<br><br>

  For someone with a learning disability, it is important to have a clean and clear website that allows an easy structure and enables cause and effect. This will be easier to engage and learn because  provides direct feedback.<br><br> 

  People  with memory problems could benefit from more videos or audios or prompts that red-directs them back to the information, some examples to consider: Bigger font sizes, intuitive and friendly to use,  – specially for the older population that are new to using technology.<br><br>

  From my clinical experience working with minimally conscious patients or people diagnosed with locked in Syndrome, I used <a href="https://eyegaze.com" >Eye Gaze</a> technology for communication. For my patients at home we used home sensors, falls detectors, epilepsy alarms,  but were required to ensure all technology was easy to set up and use.<br><br>

  <strong> Important aspects are: </strong><br><br>
   Ensure a key board friendly Website that can work without a mouse (this feature also makes Assisted Technology easier to use).<br>
  Add alternate text for imagines, tables and videos, if the browser cannot find the image, it will describe the name.<br><br>
  When deciding on the colour scheme, review visual conditions and colour contrast. Follow link below.<br><br>
  Use headers and structure content, use tables when displaying data.<br><br>

Some Websites such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/"> Web accessibility tutorials</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility">Mozilla</a> and <a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/accessibility.html"> Usability.com</a> offer practical advice on making a website more accessible.
