        <h2> 1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
        <p>Modern business's benefit from Information technology (IT) for work tasks as it increases speed, effectiveness and performance of tasks such as scheduling, sharing information, <a href="https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/marketing-project-management-software/">project management</a>, data collection and analysis, storage of information, etc,. These tasks can otherwise be time consuming and use financial resources that can be directed to other areas. IT has also shaped and changed how business operate, and tasks can be done quickly and within a pre-set budget and timeframe. In addition, it is also used for digital marketing, social media and reaching customers easily.<br><br>
        Covid-19 has been a major catalyst for business innovation specially to update to a digital model. The use of IT  has been of paramount importance in keeping busines afloat.<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/articles/ukproductivityintroduction/januarytomarch2020"> The office for national Statistics</a> reported the impact of Coronavirus and the drop on productivity levels. Companies "were forced" to innovate, adopt, upgrade and change to incorporate and welcome IT for training/meeting staff working from home and/or different parts of the world, and reaching their customers.  Healthcare has also had major shifts and it is now routinely using IT for patient’s online consultations, resources, invoicing and tracking, trace porgress, etc.

        <h2> 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully </h2> 
        <p> When completing digital projects such as making a website there are many skills that are required such as time management, problem solving, good planning,  organisational skills, professional performance and effective teamwork. Teams should have a good understanding of the expectations for the project, meet work standards, deadlines and understanding of the interdependency of their roles, expectations and the adverse outcomes.  There are also issues around individual responsibilities, levels of work productivity and quality <a href="https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/how-to-project-manage-a-social-media-campaign.php"> (Project Management)</a>, <a href="https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/marketing-project-management-software/">(Digital Project Manager)</a>.<br><br>
        For example, when building a website some software requirements could be:
        Pyhton – programming language used to make the website content interactive. 
        CSS –  the language that enables to control the style and layout of web pages.
        HTML –  the markup language for creating the website, its used to create, format text, add images, etc. <br>
        A project management tool such as <a href=" https://trello.com"> Trello</a> can be used as a visual tool for teams to work collaboratively. This allows to define agreed standards including roles, expectations and responsibilities for each team member. Progress and deadlines can also be tracked as well as consistency, productivity and quality. Other important resources necessary are the acquisition of equipment with specifications for the job.

        <h2> 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h2>
        <p><strong>When planning my Websiste, I Will be using: </strong><br><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"> Visual Code</a>, Trello for planning the project and the milestones, <a href="https://app.diagrams.net">Draw.io</a> to complete diagrams of the layout. <a href="https://coolors.co">Coolors</a> is my choice for searching colour combinations, Canva for diagrams and tables and Slak for team communication.<br><br>

        <h2> 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h2> 

        <p> Risks that may impact on digital projects can be due to cybersecurity, computer viruses, file storage and accidental deletion or removal. Other issues can be due to human errors such as lack of definition of the project, or agreed standards with the client, low productivity, inefficient risk management and not meeting agreed deadlines.

        <h2> 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </h2>
            
        <p>After analysing the project and requirements, the technology should match the job and project, if the software matches the job. Other aspects are if the person has experience using the software. This last point includes taking into account if the software requires constant updates for security issues. It is important to choose technology that does not need constant updates as this can impact on the project and the running of the Website.

        <h2> 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve  your outcomes. How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>

        <p>Using Trello to start planning my website helped me to have a visual guide of the steps needed, including the different stages required for the project. It is helping me to deconstruct the project into easily manageable steps. I’m planning ahead and can identify the tasks I’m actively working on, the completed tasks and analysis of the whole process in a categorised way.<br>
        GitHub is a repository hosting service that provides a webbased graphical interface, helps as a system to manage changes made in files and folders and can also help by allowing teams to collaborate. See the video above with further details on GitHub.
