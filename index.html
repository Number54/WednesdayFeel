        <h2>Occupational Therapy Learning new Skills in Tech.</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><strong>Welcome to my Webpage experiment!</strong> 
        <br><br>
        I’m Laila, I’m a trained <a href=" https://www.rcot.co.uk/about-occupational-therapy/what-is-occupational-therapy">Occupational Therapist</a>, with experience treating people that suffered brain injuries. I have also designed and managed service development projects, trained students and other professionals.<br><br>
        I have graduated from Brunel University in West London and completed my PostGrad training at Oxford Brookes University. For the last 14 years I worked as an Occupational Therapist for the NHS and the Private sector. During this time I have been privileged enough to help some truly wonderful individuals.<br><br>
        I have experience managing teams, dealing with complex cases, risk assessment and problem solving including work in high pressure environments such as Accident and Emergency (A&E).  I've worked with clients with varying conditions including:
        Brain injuries,  
        Major trauma, 
        Hand therapy retraining and rehabilitation and 
        Orthopaedic conditions.<br><br><br>
        <strong>What is Occupational Therapy ? </strong> <br><br>
        Occupational Therapy (OT) is a career based on treating the body and the mind by assisting people to get their lives back on track after an accident or ilness. OTs do this through a variety of treatments, paired with task-orietated rehabilitation. The core skills involve  deconstructing activities to understand the root cause of a health problem and after analysis, we provide a personalised crafted solution. In a nutshel; its about finding something that has a meaning for the person, adapt and use it as a rehabiliation tool or goal. We help people navigating from ilness to health and wellbeing.<br><br> 
        <strong>It is a holistic approach treatment centred on:</strong>
        the Person (wtheir likes, dreams and goals), 
        their Environment (this includes equipment for home and to help access buildings such as rails and ramps), 
        their Health and Wellbeing,
        Families and 
        Employment/Work

        <h2>Career Change and a New Experience Ahead</h2>
        <p> <strong>The journey from a suspicious technophobe to learning Python</strong><br><br>
        I'm a person that's always striving and always looking for an opportunity to learn more. For this reason, I've embarked towards this new experience learning at <a href="https://wearecodenation.com">Codenation</a>.<br><br>
        Prior to this I had only experienced technology as a user. When working, I have trialed, tested and used <br><a href="https://eyegaze.com"> Eye Gaze</a> and <a href="https://www.hocoma.com"> assistive Technology</a> before teaching it to patients.<br><br>
        The experience at Codenation, has been unique and its helpig me to remove some barriers "resistance" to merging technology within rehabilitation. Small aspects such as learning to use Trello, inspired me to develp ways to use it within my own daily routine for produtivity. I am still stubborn, specially as I see them as abstract tools and I prefer more concrete and low techie tools, but now I am starting to consider replacing them.... but I am still testing how effective these tools can be! <br><br>
        This has been an interesting experience in terms of using a wide range of skills including combining research with practical knowledge. From the first day, I have been analysing the materials and learning opportunities including how to adapt to such different skills. I have been reviewing the cognitive demands of learning Phyton as a new acquired skill, the combination of the cognitive demands and the physical effects on sleep patterns and general behaviours. This led me to start searching interesting studies on programmer's disrupted sleep patterns. <br><br>
        <strong> Learning Python has been a fascinating journey fullued by curiosity, some coffee and a hate/love relatioship with google search.</strong> <br><br>I have started to appreciate and value technology more and the impact and possibilities for rehabilitation systems, productivity within healthcare and to improve the patient’s experience.<br><br> </p>
