        <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello  </h2>
        <p>For my website, I have used <a href=" https://trello.com"> Trello</a> for planning- it has allowed me to prepare all the steps and some direction on how to complete the tasks. I have originally used a we design template but ended up changing to a simple Kanban template with To do, Doing and done. This allowed me to reduce many steps that were not relevant for this project and  the change  saved me time.<br><br>
        I have used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"> Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</a>throughout and the flexibility and user-friendly tasks allowed me to carry on with the code and also uploading the colours palette straight from Coolors.<br>
        Using <a href="https://coolors.co">Coolors</a> allowed me to search and match the colours for my website in a very straight forward way. I found it to be user friendly and practical for the required task. <br><br>
        I have also used <a href="https://app.diagrams.net">Draw.io</a> for the website diagrams, this tool allowed me to have a clear visual prompt on the steps and project. Draw.io, has taken me a few sessions to learn. But once I understood the processes and how the layout expands according to the needs of the project, it gave me a different perspective of the potential. I now use it for most of the planning and as concrete visual tool.

        <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello  </h2>
        <p>For this project, I have used Trello, Draw.io, VS Code, Canva and Coolors. I have found all the tools appropriate and easy to use for this project.

        <h2> 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? 
        </h2>
        <p>I am happy with the Webpage as it was my first time completing this type of project. 
        I like the clean look and feel of the page. <br><br>
        In terms of functionality and aesthetics it does need further work and improvements, I could have added a logo, more images and worked on the  accessibility tools. However,  I'm aware that I do not possess the technical skills and knowledge required to complete the tasks the way I have envisaged.
         </p>
    
        <h2> 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
        <p> <strong>I would have added the following improvements:</strong><br><br>
        Navigation bar with separated buttons, with symbols and aligned to the right side.<br>
        2 column layout, with the second column for a search bar on interesting blog subjects.<br>
        Use less words for more impact and add videos, audio and more accessibility tools. 
        </p>
